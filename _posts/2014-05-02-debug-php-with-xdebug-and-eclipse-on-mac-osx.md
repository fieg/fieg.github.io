Setting up debugging for PHP can be quite a pain in the ass. In this serie I will explain how you can setup Xdebug on Mac OSX and how to use it with Eclipse PDT.

* [Part 3: Debugging PHP with Eclipse]({% post_url 2014-05-03-debugging-php-with-eclipse-and-xdebug %})

All three parts will be posted within the next week, one on Monday, one on Wednesday and one on Friday. If you want to join in make sure you meet the following requirements:
